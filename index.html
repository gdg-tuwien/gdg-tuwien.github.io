    <h2>about</h2>
    <p><i>In short:</i> We're a graduate student club that likes to throw geeky events.</p>

    <p>Hello World! We are the first official, student-led campus chapter of Google's worldwide developer network in Vienna, Austria.</p>

    <p>
      Our community primarily consists of graduate students studying computer science or mathematics.
      We strive to create an inclusive space aimed at (1) promoting collaboration between top researchers and industry professionals and
      (2) helping students transition from academia to industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      We achieve this through events such as speaker series, academic paper reading groups and casual social gatherings.
      These events span various topics within computer science, with a strong focus on machine learning, statistical learning and data systems.
    </p>
<!--     <p>We are a volunteer-run, official chapter of Google's worldwide developer network. We bring together curious minds from all walks of life in Vienna, Austria.</p> -->
<!--     <p>Our vision is to provide an environment to deeply engage with data systems and learning algorithms by providing speaker series, reading groups and social events.</p> -->
